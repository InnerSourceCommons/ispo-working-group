## What We Do 🚀

**We build InnerSource resources together!**

- 📚 Patterns & Practices
- 📖 Managing InnerSource Projects book
- 🎓 Learning materials
- 🛠️ Tools & templates

**How?** Through **attending our biweekly meetings** and **contributing to our Kanban board**.

<!--
So what do we actually do? We create resources for people doing InnerSource work at scale.
We do this through something called "mobbing" - it's like pair programming but with a whole team.
You rotate between being the Driver (who types), Navigator (who proposes solutions), and Gallery (who observes and suggests).
It's actually really fun and you learn a ton!
