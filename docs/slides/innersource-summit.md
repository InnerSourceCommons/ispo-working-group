![bg right 60%](../assets/ispo-participants.svg)
If you're in any of these groups, we invite you to join us:

* InnerSource responsibilities in an Open Source Program Office (OSPO)
* Platform Engineering Teams
* Other centralized groups such as Enterprice Architecture
<!-- KEY MESSAGE 3:  -->

--- 
<!--- Slide 4 --->

But what is an InnerSource Program Office (ISPO)?

"Person(s) working on improving the internal code collaboration experience at full organization scale"

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 4:  

Technically, ISPO is an acronym. InnerSource Programs Office. 
Often however, the people doing ISPO related work in a company aren't in their own team. 
They are part of an OSPO, part of a centralized engineering team, maybe they are single person working under a head engineering. 
It is variable... and for our purpoeses though, it is just someone with InnerSource responsibilities (however you define that)
be it on an OSPO, platform engineering, or any other centralized group.

## Lots of overlap

You don't formally need an ISPO for this content to be useful

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 5:  
Introduce OSPO vs. ISPO. You don't formally need an ISPO for this content to be useful.

-->

--- 
<!--- Slide 8 --->

Q: WHY is the ISPO working group a subset of InnerSource Commons?

A: We focus on accelerating teams that run and support InnerSource across an organization rather than individuals.
<!-- KEY MESSAGE 8:  
WHY: The scope of the InnerSource Programs Office (ISPO) working group is more focused on the teams that run and support InnerSource across an organization rather than guidance for projects or individuals
-->

Examples of products we are working on specifically for teams that drive InnerSource company-wide:

- Metrics: 
- SCM (Source Code Management)
- InnerSource Project Assessment and Linting

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 9:  
Focus is to support the people/teams that do InnerSource organization-wide
These are all areas where many people in the working group have tried different things, have different lessons to share, 
and want to hear how things they are actively considering have worked out at other companies. 
-->
--- 

<!--- Slide 10--->

#### Source Code Management (SCM) is: 

"How do you set up GitHub, GitLab, etc. configuration at an enterprise level to best balance security and collaboration?"

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 10:  
What is source control management
-->

---
<!--- Slide 11 --->

What did I get from contributing to Source Code Management project?

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 11:  
 Why did I contribute to Source Code Management project (Justin)
 1. Get more value from hard won lessons by sharing them with others externally. 
 2. Want my perspective in external resources so I can refer to it rather than it just being Justin's opinion in an email.
 3. Want to confirm my opinion is aligned with others who have struggled through this at their company as this makes me more confident when I make a position internally. 
 4. Sharing makes it more likely InnerSource Commons people give you feedback on unrelated areas. They are more likely to spend their time on you.
-->

--- 

<!--- Slide 12--->

#### InnerSource Metrics include: 

* **Usage count** — how many times the InnerSource project is used.
* **Code contributions** — Count of commits that do not come from the project owner. 

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 12:  
Are the the metrics being collected, why, and give examples of different companies?
-->

---
<!--- Slide 13 --->

How did I benefit from collecting examples of how different companies are using these metrics?

<!-- KEY MESSAGE 12:  
 (Jeff)

I built connections with people facing the same challenges as me. As a result of contributing to the metrics project, I have a network of people I can reach out to when I have questions or need advice.

My future self will also benefit when it comes time to begin measuring InnerSource projects at my company. I will have a list of metrics that have been used by other companies, and I will know who to reach out to for advice.
