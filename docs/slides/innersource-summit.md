<!--- Slide 3: Key Message --->

But what is an InnerSource Program Office (ISPO)?

"Person(s) working on improving the internal code collaboration experience at full organization scale"

<!-- Slide 3: Key Message 

Technically, ISPO is an acronym. InnerSource Programs Office. 
Often however, the people doing ISPO related work in a company aren't in their own team. 
They are part of an OSPO, part of a centralized engineering team, maybe they are single person working under a head engineering. 
It is variable... and for our purpoeses though, it is just someone with InnerSource responsibilities (however you define that)
be it on an OSPO, platform engineering, or any other centralized group.

Q: WHY is the ISPO working group a subset of InnerSource Commons?

A: We focus on accelerating teams that run and support InnerSource across an organization rather than individuals.

Examples of products we are working on specifically for teams that drive InnerSource company-wide:

* InnerSource Project Metrics
* SCM (Source Code Management)
* InnerSource Project Assessment and Linting

<!-- Slide 8: Key Message

Focus is to support the people/teams that do InnerSource organization-wide
These are all areas where many people in the working group have tried different things, have different lessons to share, 
and want to hear how things they are actively considering have worked out at other companies.

<!--- Slide 10: Key Message --->

#### Source Code Management (SCM) is: 

"How do you set up GitHub, GitLab, etc. configuration at an enterprise level to best balance security and collaboration?"

<!--- Slide 11: Key Message --->

What did I get from contributing to Source Code Management project?

<!-- Slide 11: Key Message

 Why did I contribute to Source Code Management project (Justin)
 1. Get more value from hard won lessons by sharing them with others externally. 
 2. Want my perspective in external resources so I can refer to it rather than it just being Justin's opinion in an email.
 3. Want to confirm my opinion is aligned with others who have struggled through this at their company as this makes me more confident when I make a position internally. 
 4. Sharing makes it more likely InnerSource Commons people give you feedback on unrelated areas. They are more likely to spend their time on you.

***Example InnerSource Metrics***

üëÄ **Usage count** ‚Äî how many times the InnerSource project is used.
ü§ù **Code contributions** ‚Äî Count of commits not from the project owner.

<!-- Slide 12: Key Message 

What are InnerSource Metrics?

To demonstrate the value of InnerSource, we need to measure it. As ISPO leaders, we're often asked to articulate the value of InnerSource to our stakeholders. Using the InnerSource Metrics project, we can measure the value of InnerSource meaningfully to our stakeholders.

For example, usage count demonstrates the reuse of code or other valuable artifacts that would otherwise be duplicated, and code contributions demonstrate collaboration's value, leading to trust and longer employee retention.

We've built a graph of Goals, Questions, and Metrics to help you answer your stakeholders' questions.
-->

---
<!--- Slide 13: Key Message --->

How did I benefit from collecting these goals, questions, and metrics?

<!-- Slide 13: Key Message

Through my involvement in the metrics project, I didn't just gather data; I built a network. I connected with professionals who, like me, were navigating the world of InnerSource metrics. This wasn't just about numbers but about people facing similar challenges.

As I contributed to this project, my professional network grew exponentially. As a result of these efforts, I'm connected to great, like-minded professionals ready to help expand the value of the InnerSource Commons.

Looking ahead, this experience isn't a one-time benefit. It's an investment in the future. When my company expands InnerSource project measurement, we'll be steps ahead, armed with knowledge, connections, and a deep understanding of diverse approaches.
