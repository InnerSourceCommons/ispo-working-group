<!--- Slide 3: Key Message --->

But what is an InnerSource Program Office (ISPO)?

"Person(s) working on improving the internal code collaboration experience at full organization scale"

<!-- Slide 3: Key Message 

Technically, ISPO is an acronym. InnerSource Programs Office. 
Often however, the people doing ISPO related work in a company aren't in their own team. 
They are part of an OSPO, part of a centralized engineering team, maybe they are single person working under a head engineering. 
It is variable... and for our purpoeses though, it is just someone with InnerSource responsibilities (however you define that)
be it on an OSPO, platform engineering, or any other centralized group.

<!--- Slide 11: Key Message --->

What did I get from contributing to Source Code Management project?

<!-- Slide 11: Key Message

 Why did I contribute to Source Code Management project (Justin)
 1. Get more value from hard won lessons by sharing them with others externally. 
 2. Want my perspective in external resources so I can refer to it rather than it just being Justin's opinion in an email.
 3. Want to confirm my opinion is aligned with others who have struggled through this at their company as this makes me more confident when I make a position internally. 
 4. Sharing makes it more likely InnerSource Commons people give you feedback on unrelated areas. They are more likely to spend their time on you.

#### Example InnerSource Metrics

* **Usage count** — how many times the InnerSource project is used.

<!-- Slide 12: Key Message 

Are the the metrics being collected, why, and give examples of different companies?

<!--- Slide 13: Key Message --->

How did I benefit from collecting examples of how different companies are using these metrics?

<!-- Slide 13: Key Message

I built connections with people facing the same challenges as me. As a result of contributing to the metrics project, I have a network of people I can reach out to when I have questions or need advice.

My future self will also benefit when it comes time to begin measuring InnerSource projects at my company. I will have a list of metrics that have been used by other companies, and I will know who to reach out to for advice.
