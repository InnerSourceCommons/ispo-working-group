This document describes how to add a new participant to the working group.
This is what you should do when a new person [files a "join working group" issue](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/ispo-working-group?tab=readme-ov-file#joining-the-working-group).

1. Send them an invite to the ["ispo working group" GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/InnerSourceCommons/teams/ispo-working-group).

That's it!
