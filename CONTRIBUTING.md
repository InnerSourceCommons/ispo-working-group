Welcome!
Every person creating InnerSource-related content or tools within their company should contribute to this working group.
This working group helps all to get feedback on this work and to share it so that others can leverage it as well.
Check out our [README.md] for more details.

## 3 Ways to Contribute

1. Contribute your InnerSource-related content.

    * We track contributions on this [Kanban board].
    * Get access to contribute to the board by [joining the ISPO Working Group team].
    * Create a new card in the **No Status** column describing your contribution and the challenge it helps solve.
    * Assign the new card to yourself by clicking the link on the card.
    * Check to see if your contribution is related to any of the existing [InnerSource Patterns].
    * Learn more about the next Working Group meeting by joining [#ispo-working-group] in [InnerSource Commons Slack].
    * During the meeting, discuss your card and what you plan to contribute.

2. Review others' content.

    * Find something interesting on the [Kanban board].
    * Write a comment on the card indicating your interest.

3. Attend a working group meeting.

    * The [InnerSource Commons Slack] [#ispo-working-group] community will post the next meeting.

## New Content

When contributing new content, it can go into one of a few locations:

* If it can be represented as a pattern, then contribute it to the [InnerSource Patterns] project.
Be sure to check if there is an existing pattern that you can just update.
* If it can be represented as a training segment, then contribute it to the [InnerSource Learning Path] project.
* Documents that don't fit either of these categories (e.g. graphics, opinionated document, etc.) can go directly into this `ispo-working-group` repo as markdown.
If your content cannot be represented in markdown (or you are not comfortable working in markdown) then you can put it in the [ISPO Working Group GDrive].
This content may be converted to markdown later.

Regardless of where the content is created, you should attribute all the contributors to the resulting work (e.g. in the _Authors_ or _Acknowledgements_ sections of Patterns).
 
## Project Board

 InnerSource solutions to challenges are discovered, produced, and spread in this working group.
We track this production on a [Kanban board] with the following columns:

1. **Challenge**.  This means that we've identified such-and-such a thing as a challenge.
2. **In Progress**.  Someone is working on a proposal for a solution to the challenge.
3. **Proposed**.  We have a proposal for a solution to the challenge.
This could be to write an article, code up a tool, create a training video, etc.
1. **Internal**.  We have implemented the solution internally in a company.
1. **External**.  We have made the solution available externally.
1. **Validated**.  More than one company is using the solution.

A regular meeting proposes new challenges, discusses ideas, and demos solutions.
In many cases, solutions are shareable with other InnerSource Commons working groups; (e.g. [Patterns][InnerSource Patterns], [Learning Path][InnerSource Learning Path]).
