Welcome!
Every person creating InnerSource-related content or tools within their company should contribute to this working group.
This working group helps all to get feedback on this work and to share it so that others can leverage it as well.
Check out our [README.md] for more details.

## 3 Ways to Contribute

1. Contribute your InnerSource-related content.

    * We track contributions on this [Kanban board].
    * Get access to contribute to the board by [joining the ISPO Working Group team].
Create a new card in the **No Status** column describing your contribution and the challenge it helps solve.
    * Assign the new card to yourself.
    * Learn more about the next Working Group meeting by joining [#ispo-working-group] in [InnerSource Commons Slack].
    * During the meeting, discuss your card and what you plan to contribute.

2. Review others' content.

    * Find something interesting on the [Kanban board].
    * Write a comment on the card indicating your interest.

3. Attend working group meeting.

    * The [InnerSource Commons Slack] [#ispo-working-group] community will post the next meeting.

## Project Board

 InnerSource solutions to challenges are discovered, produced, and spread in this working group.
We track this production on a [Kanban board] with the following columns:

1. **Challenge**.  This means that we've identified such-and-such a thing as a challenge.
1. **Proposed**.  We have a proposal for a solution to the challenge.
This could be to write an article, code up a tool, create a training video, etc.
1. **Internal**.  We have implemented the solution internally in a company.
1. **External**.  We have made the solution available externally.
1. **Validated**.  More than one company is using the solution.

A regular meeting proposes new challenges, discusses ideas, and demos solutions.
It is expected that the implementation of many solutions may be contributions to other working groups in the InnerSource Commons (e.g. Patterns, Learning Path).
