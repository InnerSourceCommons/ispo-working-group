Welcome!
Every person creating InnerSource-related content or tools within their company should contribute to this working group.
This working group helps all to get feedback on this work and to share it so that others can leverage it as well.
Check out our [README.md] for more details.

## 3 Ways to Contribute

1. Contribute your InnerSource-related content.

    * We track contributions on this [Kanban board].
    * Get access to contribute to the board by [joining the ISPO Working Group team].
    * Once you have access, create a new card in the **No Status** column describing the content that you want to contribute and what challenge it helps to solve.
    * Assign the new card to yourself.
    * Join [#ispo-working-group] channel in the [InnerSource Commons Slack] to discover when is the next working group meeting.
    * In the meeting, discuss your card and what you are planning to contribute and agree on next steps.

2. Review others' content.

    * Open the [Kanban board] and find something that is interesting to you to review.
    * Leave a comment on the card indicating that you are interested in reviewing.

3. Attend working group meeting.

    * Join [#ispo-working-group] channel in the [InnerSource Commons Slack] to discover when is the next working group meeting.

## Project Board

This working group tracks the discovery, production, and spread of solutions to challenges with InnerSource.
We track this production on a [Kanban board] with the following columns:

1. **Challenge**.  This means that we've identified such-and-such a thing as a challenge.
1. **Proposed**.  We have a proposal for a solution to the challenge.
This could be to write an article, code up a tool, create a training video, etc.
1. **Internal**.  We have implemented the solution internally in a company.
1. **External**.  We have made the solution available externally.
1. **Validated**.  More than one company is using the solution.

We have a regular meeting where we will list new challenges, discuss proposed solutions, and demo finished solutions.
It is expected that the implementation of many solutions may be contributions to other working groups in the InnerSource Commons (e.g. Patterns, Learning Path).
